## Research (7 years)

*1. IRCAM/CNRS/INRIA - Post Doctoral Researcher*
* Studied the perception of motor learning in tasks involving complex and creative movements by implementing a **metric learning** approach on top of Dynamical Time Warping (*Pytorch*).\
Published in [PLOS One](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03790829/).
* Improved upon and released an **open‑source project** on Github and Pypi providing the soft‑DTW algorithm for CUDA devices (*Pytorch, CUDA*).\
Available as [pysdtw](https://github.com/toinsson/pysdtw), [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/pysdtw?period=total&units=international_system&left_color=black&right_color=orange&left_text=Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/pysdtw).
* Optimised a training schedule for a motor task using **reinforcement learning** and MABs based on a framework specialised in interactive machine learning (Marcelle, Javascript, Python).\
Submitted to IHM’22.
* Developed a prototype for movement exploration and modelling based on an algorithm performing live incremental clustering of time series (Javascript, MaxMSP, Python, C++).\
Demoed at [NIME’22](https://nime.pubpub.org/pub/8zdsd4ar/).

*2. University of Glasgow - PhD Candidate*
* Researched [computational methods for the study of novel gestural interactions](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/78981/):
  - **Deployed discriminative models** (Keras) to create virtual surfaces from RGB‑D sensors.\
        Published at [ISS’17](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3132272.3135074).
  - **Optimised gameplay experiences** for custom game controllers using user probabilistic modelling.\
        Available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14788).
  - Explored and characterised user physical capabilities with audio‑based reinforcement learning.
  - **Recorded a synthetic dataset** for detecting repetitive movement from accelerometer data and **wrote from scratch a deep model** based on 1D convolutions (Python, Keras).
* Contributed to the European project MoreGrasp:
  - **Led redaction** of deliverable documents involving coordination with several project members.
  - Implementated visual feedback mechanisms on smartwatches (Android).
  - **Prepared live demos** and posters for review meetings.
  - **Established contacts** with health practitioners at Glasgow’s hospital leading to workshops and a funding proposal.
* Analysed visualisation techniques ([Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/toinsson/raviz)) for low‑dimensional embeddings, i.e. t‑SNE.
* **Tutored the courses Artificial Intelligence and Data Fundamentals** for Undergraduate and Master students.
* Developed and released open source software for Intel Realsense camera. This package was recommended by Intel as a primary choice for community maintained Python bindings (until librealsense 2.0 was released) and has accrued over one hundred stars on github.\
Available as [pyrealsense](https://github.com/toinsson/pyrealsense), [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/pyrealsense?period=total&units=international_system&left_color=black&right_color=orange&left_text=Downloads)](https://pepy.tech/project/pyrealsense).

## Industry (7 years)

*1. Now&Net*
* Co-founded a startup providing a collective musical experience organised around DJ-ing.
* Developped a proof-of-concept recommender system (Neo4j) for creating attractive playlists.
* Wrote R&D plans leading to the successful application to the status of JEI.

*2. Ericsson AB*
* **SCRUM master** [2013/2014]: Acted as the ''guardian of the process'' to facilitate daily operations of a cross functional team (8 people). Animated planning meetings, daily follow-up meetings and retrospective meetings.
* **System engineer** AT&T laboratory [summer 2012]: Integrated features into the customer network with laboratory and in-the-field experiments.
* **Research engineer** at Ericsson Research [2012]: Prepared the 4G+ prototype for the Mobile World Congress.
* **Software Developer** 4G/LTE [2008/2014]: Developped algorithms (embedded C) from standard 3GPP specifications. Extended and supported an Erlang test framework used by 50 engineers. Provided training sessions in Stockholm and Beijing.
