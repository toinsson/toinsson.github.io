I am a trained researcher in Human and Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on Machine Learning and User Experience. My research has involved coming up with innovative ways for solving untackled problems in the context of novel gestural interactions. This usually implied collecting data from real users for the creation of robust datasets before modelling their interactions with deep or probabilistic models.

I am also a skilled software developper. Starting with an experience in the telecom industry, I learned to code in C on massively parallel embedded machines and delivered production ready software. I then moved on to Python for more scientific tasks while keeping performance in mind. I now use modern frameworks such as pytorch or docker for training and deploying new models. Some of my work has been, when possible, open sourced.

In summary, I learned how to model user data using machine learning and HCI. My writings have been published in peer reviews journals and conferences and I have been involved in the review process as an expert in my field. The software I write has been vetted several times by the open source community and I have shown leadership in the industry as a SCRUM master.
