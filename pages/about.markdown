I am a trained researcher in Human and Computer Interaction, focusing on Machine Learning and User Experience. My research has involved coming up with innovative ways for solving untackled problems in the context of novel gestural interactions. This usually involved collecting data from real users for the creation of robust datasets before modelling their interactions with deep or probabilistic models.

I am also a skilled software developper. Starting with my experience in the telecom industry, I learned to code in C on massively parallel embedded machines and delivered production ready software. I then moved on to Python for more scientific tasks but keeping performance in mind. I now use modern framework such as pytorch or docker for training models and deploying new packages. Some of my work has been, when possible, open sourced.
